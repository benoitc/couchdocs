Getting started with Futon, CouchDB's Web administration console.

CouchDB comes with a built in web front end which can be accessed by your browser by simply navigating to:

  [[http://localhost:5984/_utils/]]

From there you can create or delete databases and manage individual couchdb documents (analogous to records).

Among the other utilities are a !JavaScript shell, a replicator GUI and a test suite.
