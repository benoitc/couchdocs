Temporary page to collect our board report for May 2008

=== CouchDB ===
CouchDB is a distributed document-oriented database system written in Erlang. The project entered incubation on February 12th, 2008.

Work continued on adding the Reduce-part of our Map/Reduce powered view system. Code for this is not yet in SVN, but is near completion. We also began making CouchDB configurable at runtime. IBM want to contribute JSearch-(JSON indexing built on Lucene)-support to CouchDB. We are in the process of discussing how to do this with the developers. JSearch as IBM-internal clearance of being added to Apache projects. The license of this unknown at this stage.

Finally, we have been discussion open work items for our upcoming 0.8 and 1.0 releases respectively. We hope to be able to produce a 0.8 release soon.
